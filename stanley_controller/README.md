# Stanley Controller

## Overview
The Stanley Controller is the lateral steering controller implementation proposed in "Autonomous Automobile Trajectory Tracking for Off-Road Driving: Controller Design, Experimental Validation and Racing" [1]. A large portion of code is directly taken from mpc_follower since it is well written and documented. 


There are 2 nodes related to Stanley controller.
 - `/mpc_waypoint_converter` : This is directly copied from mpc_follower node. For detailed info, please refer to README.md in mpc_follower.
 - `/stanley_controller` : generates control command (`/twist_raw` or/and `/ctrl_cmd`) to follow `/mpc_waypoints` generated by /mpc_waypoint_converter.


## Input and Output for mpc_follower
- input
    - /mpc_waypoints : reference waypoints (generated in mpc_waypoints_converter)
    - /current_pose : self pose
    - /vehicle_status : vehicle information (as velocity and steering angle source)
- output
    - /twist_raw : command for vehicle
    - /ctrl_cmd : command for vehicle
